{"name":"Bml","tagline":"The Basic Matrix Library (bml)","body":"# Build Instructions #\r\n\r\nThe bml library is built with CMake.  For your convenience, we provide\r\na shell script which goes through the necessary motions and builds the\r\nlibrary, runs the tests, and installs it (in the `install` directory).\r\nSimply run:\r\n\r\n    $ ./build.sh compile\r\n\r\nand the library will be built in the `build` directory.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites ##\r\n\r\nIn order to build the library, the following tools need to be installed:\r\n\r\n  - `gcc` with Fortran support\r\n  - `>=cmake-2.8.8`\r\n  - `>=python-2.7`\r\n\r\n## If the build fails ##\r\n\r\nIn case the build fails for some reason, please email the developers\r\nat <qmmd-all@lanl.gov> and attach the files\r\n\r\n    build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log\r\n    build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log\r\n\r\n# Developer Suggested Workflow #\r\n\r\nWe try to preserve a linear history in our main (master)\r\nbranch. Instead of pulling (i.e. merging), we suggest you use:\r\n\r\n    $ git pull --rebase\r\n\r\nAnd then\r\n\r\n    $ git push\r\n\r\nTo push your changes back to the server.\r\n\r\n## Coding Style ##\r\n\r\nPlease indent your C code using\r\n\r\n    $ indent -gnu -nut -i4 -bli0 -cli4 -ppi0 -cbi0 -npcs -bfda\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
