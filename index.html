<a id="build-instructions" class="anchor" href="#build-instructions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Build Instructions</h1>

<p>The bml library is built with CMake.  For your convenience, we provide
a shell script which goes through the necessary motions and builds the
library, runs the tests, and installs it (in the <code>install</code> directory).
Simply run:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./build.sh compile
</code></pre>

<p>and the library will be built in the <code>build</code> directory.</p>

<h2>
<a id="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>In order to build the library, the following tools need to be installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>gcc</code> with Fortran support</li>
<li><code>&gt;=cmake-2.8.8</code></li>
<li><code>&gt;=python-2.7</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="if-the-build-fails" class="anchor" href="#if-the-build-fails" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>If the build fails</h2>

<p>In case the build fails for some reason, please email the developers
at <a href="mailto:qmmd-all@lanl.gov">qmmd-all@lanl.gov</a> and attach the files</p>

<pre><code>build/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log
build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a id="developer-suggested-workflow" class="anchor" href="#developer-suggested-workflow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Developer Suggested Workflow</h1>

<p>We try to preserve a linear history in our main (master)
branch. Instead of pulling (i.e. merging), we suggest you use:</p>

<pre><code>$ git pull --rebase
</code></pre>

<p>And then</p>

<pre><code>$ git push
</code></pre>

<p>To push your changes back to the server.</p>

<h2>
<a id="coding-style" class="anchor" href="#coding-style" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Coding Style</h2>

<p>Please indent your C code using</p>

<pre><code>$ indent -gnu -nut -i4 -bli0 -cli4 -ppi0 -cbi0 -npcs -bfda
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the script <code>indent.sh</code> to indent all C code.</p>
